# ðŸŒ† Dawn of Near

First things first. **What is** Dawn of Near**?**  the game is **a complex city building and trading game** and while this gives an overview of the game, we would like to take an opportunity to describe in more detail exactly what the game is. To do that, I need to give some context. My true passion is for challenging **games you can get lost in.** In order to do that, the player needs to be given incredible amount of control over the world. For a city builder this means letting them take on all aspects of building and managing a city. with Dawn of Near, we want you to lose track of time managing your city and trying to manufacture and sell more than your enemies. We want you to get that **just five more minutes** feeling every time you play, cities will rise and fall but this time, money is on the table.

You will need to balance investment by bringing in new businesses and jobs to your city vs. other city expenditures and balancing taxes, tariffs etc, you need to have an educated population in order to build specialized buildings like CPU factories or nuclear reactors that would allow you to sell electricity to other player owned cities. Designing an adequate traffic network to keep commerce flowing and allowing inhabitants to reach their destination timely, their will also be a global economy and factors like supply chain disruptions (caused by corporate espionage ;)  disasters etc, that can result in global GDP slowdown which would affect everyone, you get the point. Trade is just as important as city management, no city will be able to fully meets its demands of everything like being a tourist destination, advanced manufactures, have all basic commodities required etc, thus you are required to import and export. You will have to make hard decision in every step along the way .\

Each city will be an NFT and up to 2 players can build one city, each city will have a central bank and will be able to issue its own token to be used in your own city, other cities can also chose to adopt your own token thus you will be able to have an alliance of cities which would make your city token more valuable.  There is also the near protocol central bank and players can choose to take a loan from it, for a fee of course. You can choose to keep building or withdraw some profit, after all we are here to make money and have fun. investors might also choose to invest in your token if they see potential and earn a percentage of your city/alliance total profits (or lose, who knows). How cool is that ?.

One of the biggest problems in crypto gaming today is that P2E games are simply not fun. They are designed with money and profit first rather than with fun in mind first. The biggest example of this is the collapse of axie infinity game economy. The collapse happened because gamers did not have any interest in the game or any of the assets, they simply wanted to sell them and make money, this meant that axie infinity economy is basically worthless. &#x20;

We aim to transition fully into gaming after Zen protocol is fully trustless as we believe there is crazy potential in P2E. P2E is resistant to market downturn (if done right). we also might rebrand from zen protocol to something else, but lets keep that a secret for now :) \
