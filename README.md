# ðŸ”¬ Overview

## Introduction to Zen Protocol

Zen protocol is a **suite** of DeFi applications bringing the missing DeFi primitives, gaming  and more under one token, $ZEN. We aim to be a fully trust-less application that will shape the future of aurora. We choose aurora for our DeFi project due to its cheap fees and fast transactions and choose Near for our gaming project due to its power and because it uses Rust, which allows us to use the novel but great Bevy 0.6 game engine. We aim to become a top 3 project on aurora in no time.

## Why Zen protocol ?

Our aim is to make $ZEN an aurora blue chip you can buy and know for sure it will go up or remain stable even in terrible markets due to the buy backs from the fees generated from our protocol, burn, gaming and investments. We believe that by capitalizing on bringing the missing DeFi primitives along with our laser focus on utility will pay off tremendously. Basically as long as DeFi and gaming exists, $ZEN will exist. &#x20;

## Innovation

Zen protocol is also bringing Crypto's first self-repaying loans with FaaS, allow our experienced DeFi Trader to mine your yield and repay your loan without having to pay heavy fees, along with traditional self-repaying loans with yield optimizer. When $USN releases its savings protocol, users will be able to deposit their money with us and get %50 in $zUSD immediately rather than have their money locked in the $USN protocol, we'll deposit the money on your behalf.

We are also considering releasing special NFTs that would grant you slightly higher liquidity back from the protocol (think 60% instead of 50%), it is meant for serious traders who will really benefit from the extra 10% ,However this is up to the community to decide.&#x20;

## What we bring

Zen protocol financial applications suite includes: two types of Self-repaying loans, automated portfolio manager, single-sided liquidity pool, boot strapping liquidity pool, no loss lottery and gaming. Zen protocol charges a small fee on each of these services and buys back $ZEN with it, with a small portion going to treasury.&#x20;

Having so many financial applications means Zen protocol will allocate funding for other developers to build on top of our protocol and leverage $zen to innovate on aurora and further increase $zen utility.&#x20;



Note the project will be releasing in an iterative manner to ensure high quality and security, with our FaaS self-repaying loans releasing last. \

Only 1 team member currently has a twitter account, however the entire team will be on twitter soon and active in the community, we decided to rush the landing page because we didn't want anyone to release before us :)
