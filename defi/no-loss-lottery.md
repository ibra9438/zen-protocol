## What is a no loss lottery ?

A lottery in which anyone who purchases a ticket has a chance to win a stash of tokensâ€”but even if you lose the drawing, you donâ€™t lose any of the money you spent to enter. In fact, your tickets just keep rolling into the next drawing again and again. You literally canâ€™t lose your money. But you _could_ win. Maybe.[\

## How we do it

Users deposit their tokens into the protocol which deposits into a yield optimizer or into one of our services(there will be multiple strategies), the tokens in the pool are used to provide liquidity, which generates interest, and every week, 15% of the interest generated by the pool gets distributed to 2 lucky winners. By simply entering the pool (minimum amount is $100, you also need to hold $100 of $ZEN regardless of your deposit) you qualify for a chance to win a lottery with no chance of losing your money and without having to buy a ticket every week, while also earning interest from investment. \


## Rules

* **minimum amount to enter a pool is $100.**
* **You need to hold $100 of $ZEN regardless of your deposit.**
* **Users can not withdraw their money for up 1 week to prevent gaming the system.**

Zen protocol charges a %1 fee + 2% of weekly interest, fees subject to revision.  &#x20;
