# ðŸ’¸ Self-repaying loans

**Self-repaying loans**: An application where you can deposit stablecoin assets, borrow against them, and then have the future yield on those assets automatically pay off your debt. A loan whose value only goes down, and where your collateral can never get liquidated because we are using stablecoins not volatile assets.

**Traditional self-repaying loans:** Traditional applications deposit users funds in a yield optimizer(aggregators) which utilize multiple investing strategies to maximize yield. Zen protocol will be monitoring multiple yield optimizers to check ones are offering the best APY and move users funds between them. The low transactions costs on aurora  and fast transactions make this process more dynamic than on other networks. We have a secret feature under planning that will make heavy use of aurora's power and give us an edge over other DeFi projects on other networks (join us on twitter and discord to keep up).

****[**FaaS**](https://www.thedefiedge.com/farming-as-a-service/) **self-repaying loans:** Traditional FaaS applications charge a high fee between 5-15% and then repay investors over time. this heavy fee can be a problem as it might take months for users to get their principle investments back, only then will they start to make a profit. Users on Zen protocol will get %50 immediately in our overcollateralized stable coin $zUSD and our hardworking DeFi farmer will get to work on repaying back your loan.&#x20;

Zen protocol charges a one time fee of %1 and %10 on the interest generated.
