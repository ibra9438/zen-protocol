# Single-sided liquidity pool

## **What is Impermanent loss?**

**Impermanent Loss**: LPs are subject to value loss when the prices of pool assets diverge, causing them to under-perform a basic buy-and-hold strategy.

## **Why single-sided liquidity pools ?**

Single-sided liquidity pools removes Impermanent Loss risk for LPs and transfers it to the protocol, which covers IL risk across the pools. The protocol uses its holdings of $ZEN to compensate for the network-wide cost of IL. While some pools may have high IL and low fees, others may have low IL and high fees. Basically we take on the other side and give you  for 100% IL protection of the trade as long as you are willing to deposit liquidity money for 100 days. Pools will have to be approved by the community as low quality tokens can serve as a risk to the protocol, Which is one of many reasons we will reward active participants in the DAO handsomely with %2.5 allocation.



Zen protocol charges %0.1-1% on every trade, subject to revision
