# Bootstrapping liquidity pools

## What are Bootstrapping liquidity pools ?

Liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs) are also known as configurable rights pools or smart pools. A smart pool essentially is a contract that manages a core pool that contains tokens to be used on an exchange.

## Why Bootstrapping liquidity pools ?

The main inspiration behind an LBP is the ability to launch tokens with low capital requirements. To achieve this, a two-token pool is set up with a project and a collateral token. The weights are then set in favor of the project token (at first). Over time, a gradual flip occurs where the collateral coin is favored by the end of the token sale. Controllers can calibrate the sale to keep the price relatively stable to maximize revenue or can decline the price to the desired minimum (e.g. the initial coin offering price).

## Breakdown

LBPs increase trust in the token launch by eliminating bot manipulation and creating a fair launch for everyone regardless of their portfolio size. Theyâ€™re designed to safeguard the reputation of new projects, gain a competitive edge over bots and prevent whales to profit through rug pulls or other manipulation techniques.&#x20;

The operating mechanism of LBPs entails adjusting the weight of the two tokens in the pool. In other liquidity pools, tokens are required to maintain a set ratio of 50:50. A weighted pool proves advantageous as it allows for a high initial price with **minimal up-front capital**. LBP controller needs to provide the new tokens and a small portion of a second asset (mostly a stablecoin) to start the pool and initiate distribution.

The programmatic adjusting of weight over time facilitates lowering of the price slowly thereby **elongating the price discovery period** enabling participants to wait for the price they think is fair to buy at.&#x20;
