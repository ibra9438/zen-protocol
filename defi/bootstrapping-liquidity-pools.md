# Bootstrapping liquidity pools

The main inspiration behind an LBP is the ability to launch tokens with low capital requirements. To achieve this, a two-token pool is set up with a project and a collateral token. The weights are then set in favor of the project token (at first). Over time, a gradual flip occurs where the collateral coin is favored by the end of the token sale. pool creators can calibrate the sale to keep the price relatively stable to maximize revenue or can decline the price to the desired minimum (e.g. the initial coin offering price).&#x20;



Say a new project wants to hold a token sale while at the same time, build deep liquidity. They can do this by enabling a custom weight/ratio and also the ability to set a fee charged by the pool. This is ideal for distributing new tokens since the LBP controller only needs to provide the new tokens and a small portion of a second asset (e.g. DAI) to start the pool and initiate distribution. Since the parameters are set in a way that releases tokens slowly with changing weights, whales are forced to split their trades into separate, small traders over a longer period of time. Thus, making it easier for everyone else to get in during the course of the sale.
