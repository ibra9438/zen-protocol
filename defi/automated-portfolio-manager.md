# Automated portfolio manager

## What is an Automated portfolio Manager ?

An Automated portfolio manager is a multi-token AMM that allows liquidity providers to act as self-r_ebalancing index funds_. Users can also create pools on the protocol with up to 8 tokens in whatever weight/ratio they wish that makes it possible for traders to trade against them. There is no such AMM on aurora now.



## What is the difference between a traditional AMM and a multi-token AMM ?

Traditional AMMs use a constant 50-50 ratio in pools and pool creators are limited to two tokens in the pool. Meanwhile, the smart contracts in Zen protocol self-re-balancing pools use a constant mean formula allowing more than two assets to be added to the pool with the ratio not limited to 50-50.

This unique approach of multi-token pools makes it possible to determine adaptive fee structures which work against market forces. As a result, it allows Zen protocol to manage volatility and change in demand in its smart pools over others in the DeFi world.

## What are the features of a multi-token AMM ?

We offer two types of pools including public pools and private pools.

Public pools are where anyone can provide liquidity to Zen protocol by adding digital assets. The parameters of these pools are set before launching and cannot be changed, even by their creators.

These pools most appeal to investors who would like to earn fees from their holdings.

Private pools are only for the creator to add or withdraw assets. Besides, it allows the creators to adjust other parameters of the pool including the acceptable assets, fees, and weighting.

A subsidiary of private pools is smart pools which are private pools owned by smart contracts. Smart pools are programmed to perform additional functions such as creating index funds and changing weights thanks to smart contracts.

\
Zen protocol charges 0.1% on every trade on top of the fee charged by pool creator.
