# Automated portfolio manager

An Automated portfolio manager is a multi-token AMM. It allows liquidity providers to act as portfolio owners. Also, they can create pools in the platform with up to 8 tokens in whatever weight they wish that makes it possible for traders to trade against them.

One of the things that a multi-token AMM is different from other traditional AMMs (uniswap) is that its users have the flexibility to create their own private liquidity pools up to 8 tokens and allocate them however they want and earn a fee on every transaction. There is no such AMM on aurora until now.
